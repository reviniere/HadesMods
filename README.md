Repo for my Hades mods

Mods require [ModUtil](https://github.com/SGG-Modding/ModUtil) to be set up too. 

For help with getting mods going, join the [Hades Modding](https://discord.com/invite/KuMbyrN) discord.

# Mods

## TwitchControl
Lets Twitch Chat interact with your game live. Speed the game up, zoom camera in, make enemies invisible, give Zag a rubber banding dash, and so much more...

## WeaponRandomizer
Every chamber you enter, your weapon is switched to a random one, and any hammers you have are removed and replaced with new random hammers for your new weapon.
